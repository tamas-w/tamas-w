-# Hello There :wave:


#### I'm Tamas, a recently graduated junior developer from Budapest.


## I would prefer to work as a full-stack dev, but I also can settle with a frontend or backend position :slightly_smiling_face:

## Technologies which I'm familiar with/have experience :computer:
- React (hooks, redux, context, axios, etc.)
- NodeJS 
- SQL / NoSQL (mysql, Mongo)

### If you're interested about more tools and technology what I'm using please check out my projects
